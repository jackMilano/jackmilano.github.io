Hi, I am Giacomo Milano. I'm a very curious person, appassionate about different things.

My main areas of interest are game development, robotics, artificial intelligence and the social consequences of technology on humanity.

I've worked for [Brain in the Box][bitbgames], an italian game development indipendent house; I was focused on multiplayer, but I've contributed on many other things.

Right now I'm working for [e-Mentor][ementor], an italian company specialised in e-learning, edutainment and serious gaming; I'm using Unity3D and web technologies (from Angular to jQuery) in my daily work routine to build hybrid apps and games.
