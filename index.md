Hi, I am Giacomo Milano. I'm a very curious person, appassionate about different things.

My main areas of interest are game development, robotics, artificial intelligence and the social consequences of technology on humanity.

I've worked for [Brain in the Box][bitbgames], an italian game development indipendent house; I was focused on multiplayer, but I've contributed on many other things.

<!-- Right now I'm working for [e-Mentor][ementor], an italian game development indipendent house; I'm focused on multiplayer but I'm contributing on many other things. -->
