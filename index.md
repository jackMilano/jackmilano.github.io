Hi, I am Giacomo Milano. I'm a very curious person, appassionate about different things.

My main areas of interest are game development, robotics, artificial intelligence and the social consequences of technology on humanity.

Right now I'm working as a programmer for [Brain in the Box][bitbgames], an italian game development indipendent house; I'm focused on multiplayer but I'm contributing on many other things.
